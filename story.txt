Once upon a time, in the deep jungle, there lived a Rabbit and Turtle who were good friends.
One day, the Rabbit kept teasing about how slow the Turtle was.
So they decided to host a race.
The race day has arrived and all the Other animals from the forest came to see who would win.
The lion was the referee and he kick started the race.
